April 13th:
I have been super busy with other stuff lately and this game really took a seat on the backburner, huge bummer.
BUT, that said... I have come back to it and have been doing a lot of work on it.
The last few days have been adding the camera feature where it doesn't scroll OB past map bounds/rendering.
This was not particularly easy and was mainly the reason I slowly stopped workng on this!

	Changes
	= camera will not scroll outside of map bounds anymore! (know more about ViewPort then I ever wanted to)
	= completely rebuilding the way the character would move and respond to touch events for movement
		= moving away from the finger dragging for movement
			= implemented a Cartesian Plain setup to determine the angle to propel our ship at
	= tidied up the Player and ViewPort classes
	
	To do
	= now that we have the theta at which our player will be moving, have to propel ship in that direction

April 14th:
Applied some changes to the player movement functions and have functioning movement...
Definitely needs some work to fine tune it, but I'll sit down with that over the next few sessions.

	Changes
	= Player moves

	To do
	= Fine tune movement
		= Way too jittery, fast and unsmooth

April 18th:
Made changes to the screen touches, for now tapping will only move the Player

	Changes
	= regarding onTouch events I changed the ACTION_MOVE event into the ACTION_DOWN

	To do
	= Add way to update each Entity that is able to move in each frame
	= Will have to apply to all MovableEntity Objects (re-use!)
		= Player, Ships, Projectiles etc...


April 19th:
Made some edits to the ViewPort class that were affecting how the edges of the ViewPort were calculated.
After mapping out the co-ordinates (countless times on my fridge calendar!) the values have been adjusted properly now.

	Changes
	= ViewPort edge calcuation
	= other minor changes in ViewPort

	To do
	= suspicions that the world2Screen() is not properly showing the ViewPort scaled to fit the full screen
		= properly draw out and map them on paper to make sure they are correct
