The goal for this week is to establish as much functionality as possible in the construction of making levels on the fly, 
as well as the seamless integration of multiple fragements within the fragment manager.

Day 1 [22/12/16]
Got the Fragments to properly display on the Android app!

	Problems
	ScreenFragment is not properly displaying the GameView object
		: might not be properly initialized?

	To do
	Have ScreenFragment properly display/launch the GameView level needed

Day 2 [23/12/16]
The ControllerFragment and ScreenFragment properly display on a single screen
The handlers for the ControllerFragment are working properly and do NOT interrupt the ScreenFragment touchEvents!

	Problems
	None

	To do
	Add the functionality to end levels and create an "EndGame" Menu
	Create an Introduction Menu to handle app Navigation
	Add shooting projectiles to the Player
		subsequent hit detection on missiles fired that are active

Day 3 [24/12/16]
Added a simple Menu to function as a means to navigate the app
Changed the Button handler to use switch statement instead of multiple handlers

	Problems
	Required Android 2.X and above to map multiple button presses at once, further research required perhaps, still want this functionality

	To do
	Link the button reaction to the proper activities so the inputs can be properly managed and translated to the displayed GameView
	Create Projectile class that extends Movable Image and create proper sublcasses Bullet, Missile

Day 4 [Dec 26/12/16]
Created an Interface to handle the communication between the ControllerFragment and parent Activity
ScreenFragment now receives the button code for the button that was pressed

	Problems
	None

	To do
	Build Projectile class
	Build Player shooting functionality
	Add functionality to the GameView to display Projectile changes

Day 5 [Dec 27/12/16]
Projectile class has been built and they shoot from the player properly.
Adjusted some of the classes that extend Entity to have better Constructor parameters.
Added hit-detection for Ships and Projectiles.

	Problems
	Concurrency issues exist when a Projectile is being deleted and we attempt to add a new one.
	The Application is already using ListIterators, will investigate issue further today/tomorrow.

	To do
	Solve Concurrency issue(s)

Day 6 [Dec 28/12/26]
Solved the Concurrency issues that were happening when Projectiles were being added/removed at the same time from the Game's View
Projectiles now register hits, remove when out of sight and do NOT crash the game!

	Problems
	None

	To do
	Level creation, ViewPort
