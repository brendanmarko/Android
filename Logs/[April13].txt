April 13th:
I have been super busy with other stuff lately and this game really took a seat on the backburner, huge bummer.
BUT, that said... I have come back to it and have been doing a lot of work on it.
The last few days have been adding the camera feature where it doesn't scroll OB past map bounds/rendering.
This was not particularly easy and was mainly the reason I slowly stopped workng on this!

	Changes
	= camera will not scroll outside of map bounds anymore! (know more about ViewPort then I ever wanted to)
	= completely rebuilding the way the character would move and respond to touch events for movement
		= moving away from the finger dragging for movement
			= implemented a Cartesian Plain setup to determine the angle to propel our ship at
	= tidied up the Player and ViewPort classes
	
	To do
	= now that we have the theta at which our player will be moving, have to propel ship in that direction
