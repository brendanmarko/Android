=========
Been falling behind on my logs sadly for the last month or so due to the amount of work I've had to do on paper. The implementation of the rotating
firing position definitely has proven to be more difficult than initially planned as well as some bugs that needed to be corrected along the way.

Completed
=========
1. Fixed RefractionHandler bugs wrt min/max bounds
2. Added some new helper classes
3. Solved (and proved) using mathematics an algorithm to solve rotation of the FP

To do
=====
1. Implement algorithm to handle FP rotations

After further analysis of the problem, my initial interpretations of the problem were proven false. Even though this problem has plagued me since
the end of July, I stuck with it and finally completed it. The math backs it up and the testing gives the results given from the mathematical
testing!!!

Completed
=========
1. Added more functions to MathHelper
2. FiringPositionHandler now properly calculates the displacements of the FP when rotations occur

To do
=====
1. Add the displacements to the position and ensure that they give the proper result!
