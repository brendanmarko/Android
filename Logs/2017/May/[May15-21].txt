======
I had known for awhile that my Projectile class and Entity/MovableEntity needed some tidying up and decided to polish off the classes before proceeding.
It's a good thing that I did, simplifying the inheritance made for an easy way to create projectiles. I will have to do some work on MovableEntity with
some sort of field for movement types later before I can look at changing the way some projectiles react with entities.

Completed
=========
1. Consolidated Projectile to use inheritance from Entity
2. Tided up Entity/MovableEntity
3. Changed all CTORs to have same pattern of variables

To do
=====
1. Add movement type field to Objects
2. Handle the new MT in GameView
