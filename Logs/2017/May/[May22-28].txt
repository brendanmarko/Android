Summary
=======
The goal of this week is to overhaul the Player movement mechanism from using simple touch events to utilizing Gestures.
This allows much greater freedom wrt the ability of the Player to move themselves.
The secondary function of this development leg is to find the angle of single_tap events from the event that is invoking it.

======
Today I added in the ability to find the angle from an Entity to a target location on the screen. I had removed similar code earlier
in favour of using the cardinal movement system only to need it again to find angles!

Completed
=========
1. Find angle from Entity wrt target location
2. Consolidate MovableEntity functions into ArmedEntity

To do
=====
1. Apply the angle found from single_tap to the trajectory of projectiles
