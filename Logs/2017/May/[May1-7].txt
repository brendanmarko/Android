May 1:
Today was a pretty relaxed day wrt to coding, just changed around some of the movement stuff that will need a bit of fine tuning.
Probably working about 75% the way I would like, likely finish it up tomorrow.
Organized the 'Log Files' into a better folder system better for archiving.

Completed:
Fixed the bound check function to stop jittery movements and made some adjustments to the Player movement and how it calculates the direction

To do:
Refine the movement system wrt the angle a bit more!
