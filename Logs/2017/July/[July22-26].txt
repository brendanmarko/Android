=======
Projectiles 2.001
=================
a. Added angle refraction capability wrt "RefractionHandler"; handles angle changes when hitting boundaries
b. Still requires some work with adjusting the Projectile's TravelVector; angular change reflected
c. Moved around some variables to ease use within classes

================
a) Projectiles now properly bounce off the world boundaries (perpindicular or reversal)
b) Cleaned up MovableEntity
c) Issue with objects not detecting bounds properly when colliding (calculating too soon!)

=======
Projectile 2.003
================
a) Detected problem with values not matching position/hitbox wrt Projectiles
