Summary

The player now can aim only within their 180-degree arc as defined by aim_bounds

Completed
=========
1. Player aim restricted to within 180-degrees of rotation angle
2. Player boost from fling adjusted, field added to ObjectInfo called "boostFactor"
3. Added helper class called 'AimBoundsHandler' that will be extended from later for detection fields

To do
=====
1. Investigate for any other Player adjustment/changes before working on Projectile interactions
