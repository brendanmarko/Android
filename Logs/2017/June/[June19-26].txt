After a lot of painstaking research and countless archived posts on StackOverflow... I have successfully worked out the primitive rotation of the Player Bitmap! This is a huge step in moving forward!

Completed
=========
1. Player Bitmap now rotates according to the position that the fingers move them

To do
=====
1. Update Hitbox to rotate with the Player as well
2. Handle updates to aim angle and other misc things

Having to map out the rotation of the Bitmap/Hitboxes has proven to be quite a task, but I finally now can discern if the rotation of the Player's fingers moving is in the clockwise
or counter-clockwise direction!

Completed
=========
1. Identiying if the motion of the Player's fingers is CW/CCW

To do
=====
1. Identify proper angle direction wrt CW/CCW motions
