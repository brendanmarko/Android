Summary 
=======
After a lot of painstaking research and countless archived posts on StackOverflow... I have successfully worked out the primitive rotation of the Player Bitmap! This is a huge step in moving forward!

Completed
=========
1. Player Bitmap now rotates according to the position that the fingers move them

To do
=====
1. Update Hitbox to rotate with the Player as well
2. Handle updates to aim angle and other misc things
