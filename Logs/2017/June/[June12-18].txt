Summary
=======
The last week had presented itself with a lot of coding challenges that focused around 2 specific problems:
1. The Player movement hitting invisible walls
2. The Player aim not functioning properly when the ViewPort shifted

These 2 problems compounded and no matter how much I attempted to fix one, the problems both remained. Plugging away at them for a week with little progress was demoralizing and I decided to step back and take a break.
Hitting that wall in development made me realize that I needed a fresh perspective and re-evaluate the issue. I took out pen/paper and spent a few days working out all the problems on paper, and voila the errors became clear.
I had not been properly accounting for displacement within the TouchEvents wrt aiming/movement and hence there was an error associated with the angles. This error became exaggerated the further from (0,0) the event was 
and revealed the nature of the problem upon inspection. Another problem I encountered was the totally mess I had made of some of my commits and I really learned a lot about git over this week while fixing the repo up,
it proved to be invaluable with restoring my code to a working point and I feel a lot more comfortable with it now!

Completed
=========
1. Fixed angle exaggeration error when Player moved from (0,0)
2. Player movement no longer hits invisible walls
3. Player movement improved also due to AEE

To do
=====
1. Implement Player rotation

Summary

Well, as it turns out, implementing multi-touch gestures is not quite as easy as I initially thought (of course!) and will require some further research and hunting online for resources. I have laid out a new
MultiTouchMgr class that will need some work, but as things sit now, I can detect multiple touches and can count how many touch events occur at a time! Now, I must properly handle them!

Completed
=========
1. Added MultiTouchMgr class

To do
=====
1. Implement Player rotation
2. Handle multi-touch events within MultiTouchMgr

Summary
=======
Great success! After reading through a lot of information (some helpful, some... not so helpful) I was finally able to get the Positions of multiple TouchEvents on the screen! I am going to abandon using the
interface 'OnTouchListener' and fully implement my own handler for TouchEvents involving multiple fingers. I will still have to plan out how I am going to handle position changes wrt the individual pointers
regarding each TouchEvent but it will likely involve calculating which direction each pointer is moving to properly deduce if a CW/CCW rotation is occuring.

Completed
=========
1. Store Positions wrt TouchEvents involving multiple fingers (for the time being 2)

To do
=====
1. Calculate whether the action is a rotation
2. Possible extension wrt Pinch motions w/o ScaleGestureDetector
