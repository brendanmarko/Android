Day 1 [04/01/17]
Finally got the file layout to load from an external class!
The addition of a new architecture to handle Levels, called LevelManager was also added
Added comments to the most important functions using in Object creation

	Completed:
	LevelManager Class
	ViewPort Class
	LevelData Class

	Problems:
	Game crashes when I touch the screen, probably something to do with the stuff I commeneted out

	To do:
	Fix onTouchEvent crash to the ScreenFragment/GameView

Day 2 [05/01/17]

	Completed:
    No longer crashes when I touch the screen!
    Fixed the implementation of the Level creator, had some loop counters mixed up causing it to render sideways!
    Made some adjustments to code and added a lot of Log.d() calls for future debugging (added toString() to some objects)

	Problems:
    Now that world creation has begun working properly it is time to handle player movement with previously written code
        : hopefully a smooth integration (please)

	To do:
    Fix player movement
    Have camera follow player and draw updates properly with world layout
