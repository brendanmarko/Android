Day 1 [04/01/17]
Note:
Finally got the file layout to load from an external class!
The addition of a new architecture to handle Levels, called LevelManager was also added
Added comments to the most important functions using in Object creation

	Completed:
	LevelManager Class
	ViewPort Class
	LevelData Class

	Problems:
	Game crashes when I touch the screen, probably something to do with the stuff I commeneted out

	To do:
	Fix onTouchEvent crash to the ScreenFragment/GameView

--> /TLDR
    : Level layout files stored in external classes can now be processed and handled

Day 2 [05/01/17]

	Completed:
	No longer crashes when I touch the screen!
	Fixed the implementation of the Level creator, had some loop counters mixed up causing it to render sideways!
	Made some adjustments to code and added a lot of Log.d() calls for future debugging (added toString() to some objects)

	Problems:
	Now that world creation has begun working properly it is time to handle player movement with previously written code
		: hopefully a smooth integration (please)

	To do:
<<<<<<< HEAD
    Fix player movement
    Have camera follow player and draw updates properly with world layout
    
--> /TLDR
    : Game properly renders now but does NOT centre on the Player as desired
    
Day 3 [09/01/17]

    Completed:
    : After having to re-do a bunch of the functions inside ViewPort, which is what I dreaded, turned out to be helpful.
    : Made optimizations to clipObjects() and A LOT of viewport related data fixes
    : Equipped with much better understanding the application now outputs level layouts, centered on the Player in the
      initial screen position on the left side!
    
    Problems:
    : None
    
    To do:
    : Add player movement 
    : Make sure camera follows player [in theory it should do this now!]

--> /TLDR
    : ViewPort and Gameview now mesh well together, fixed up variables and functions to allow this
=======
	Fix player movement
	Have camera follow player and draw updates properly with world layout
