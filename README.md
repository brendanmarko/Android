# Project Outline
This project is going to serve as my first attempt into GameDev. I'll be using the Android OS to write my own game engine where I will design, test and implement a Game while documentating all progress, difficulties, or changes that I deem noteworthy within logs.

# Goal
The ultimate goal of this project is to have a fully functioning 2D space shooter game utilizing puzzles, interesting levels, creative enemies with a challenging AI, a mission selection system and ship customization. I am keeping my goals rooted in the realm of reality as I have seen how much refactoring needed to be done from 'Phase 1' alone but I am not going to shy away from the complex things I want to implement!
