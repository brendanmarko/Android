# Project Outline
This project is going to serve as the first stepping stone in game development. Through the use of good design practices and some original ideas I am going to implement a game on the Android gaming platform.

# Goal
To Design a game similiar to Space Invaders but with some fancy mechanical additions and clever AI to present a formidable challenge to the classic game.

# Roadmap [To-do]
[x] Display GameView within Fragment

[x] Transfer all Views into Fragments for easier management

[x] Send information between Fragments in real-time to register button clicks

[ ] Dynamically use Fragments to display levels, controller, end level screen, menu etc...
