# Project Outline
This project is going to serve as the first stepping stone in game development. Through the use of good design practices and some original ideas I am going to implement a game on the Android gaming platform.

# Goal
To Design a game similiar to Space Invaders but with some fancy mechanical additions and clever AI to present a formidable challenge to the classic game.
