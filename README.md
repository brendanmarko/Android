# Project Outline
This project is going to serve as my first attempt at game development. Using the Android OS I am going to design, test and implement a Game while documentating all progress and difficulty using daily Logs when work is performed.

# Goal
The ultimate goal of this project is to have a fully functioning game application that will loosely resemble Space Invaders with a more modern approach utilizing interesting levels, creative enemies with a challenging AI, a mission selection system and ship customization.
