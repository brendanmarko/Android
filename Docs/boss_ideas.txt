Today I was asking Patrick what he thought makes for a tough or interesting boss fight; just going to jot those and my thoughts down:
	= fair fight (obviously!)
	= lots of aoe
		= stuff that is challenging to dodge, but rewarding to do so
	= larger scale for boss
	= having more than a few simple, repititive options to challenge players
		= multiple moves/tricks to keep player guessing
		= have audible/visual queues that a move might be happening
			= reduce time for these as difficulty scales
